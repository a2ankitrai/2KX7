# Primitive types

The primitive types in Java are boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double.

| Type   	|Size in Bytes  			|  Range 																	|
| --------- |:-------------------------:| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| byte  	| 1 byte  					| -128 to 127 																|   	
| short  	| 2 bytes  					| -32,768 to 32,767  														|   	
| int  		| 4 bytes  					| -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483, 647  										|   	
| long  	| 8 bytes  					| -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807  					|   	
| float  	| 4 bytes  					|  approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits) 			|   	
| double  	| 8 bytes 					| approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)  	|   	
| char 		| 2 byte  					| 0 to 65,536 (unsigned)  													|  	
| boolean  	| not precisely defined*  	| true or false  															|

## COMPUTING PARITY

The parity of a sequence of bits is 1 if the number of Is in the sequence is odd;
otherwise, it is 0. Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication.
