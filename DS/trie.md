# Trie
---

Using trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to **M * log N**, where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However the penalty is on trie storage requirements.
